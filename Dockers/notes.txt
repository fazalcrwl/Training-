its act as  package 
run on any machine such as docker 

setting up new env or dependenceies 
it will automatically setup your env 
locked in a container
conatiner will be isolated with other containers


conatiner:
 isolated env for running an application
virtual Machone :
an abstraction of a machine (physical hardware)




VMS:---------------------
physical hardware -> hypervisor 
  = 2 virtual machine completely differnt from other 
  Example:
  virtual box
  vmware 


  Cons:
  each virtual machine requires a complete os 
  for a software 
  slow to start 
  resource intensive

containers------------------------------
Allow running multiple apps in isloation
are light weight
use os of the host 
start quickly
no need a slice of hardware 

Dockers:
client Server         Docker engine 
client -> rest Api -> Server

Docker is a special kind of processor using the same os 
Windows + linux (containers)

linux-> container


installing docker

client -> serevr protocol using rest api 

Docker archs ---------------------------


Docker conatin:
Image:
image contain :
A cutdown osa runtime env such as anaconda
app  files such predict.py 
third party libs -> skleearn etc 
environment vars-> apu keys, random seed

Image->--------------- goes to cintainer


after creating container we can push it to docker hub 


instructions for running js file from one app to another :
start with os 
install node 
copy app files
run app.js 


for solving all the work we will create docker file in a container'


docker build :

      for runnign app 
FROM python:alpine -> linux small env or os 
COPY . /app (. means current drectry select all)(/app means all the files will be copied to app file in docker container) 
WORKDIR /app (setting the workdir to app dir )
CMD python app.py (cmd means runnign this comman in command line )

docker build       -t means name or tag of the docker 
sudo docker build -t firstdocker . (. means current directory )
docker image ls means list all the images in this sysytem '

Next section


 if we want or run a ny iamges we can pull from the docker hib 
  such as ubuntu we can use tge pull method or the 
  if the disrtibution is famous it wil search locally or insatlla new one from the internet 

#command
sudo docker ps 
it will tells us the how many docker process are runnign 

#command
sudo docker ps -a it will tell us the history of docker files 



docker detached mode using -d 
it will run it detached mode terminAL WILL BE FREE











--------------------------------------------------------



Docker Compose :




first removing previous dockers list 

docker conatiner rm 
removing all the docker files


building YAMl file in conatiners so we can run compose file 


---------------------------------------------------------
docker network :

bridge:
docker inspect network bridge 
it will tell us the ip 
the connection between the host and docker image bridge


Host _ip :
docker run -it  --network =host docker name 

it will run the docker with your ip 


creating your own network and mapping
docker network create -d bridge youtube 
 docker run  -it  --network=youtube --name  anything



 create your own network then run differnt containers 
 they can communicate with each other 

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 Volume Mounting 
 

 it act as  a permanent storage in docker file 
 then the conatiner wil have the access of that folder from the host 

 #command 

 docker run -it -v {location of host Folder}: foler in docker 

if we create a folder in the conatiner folder it will have the access over that folder 





-------------------------------------------------------------
Cache

run ..........
run ...........
run .........
if we change the run 2 in the line all the cache below 3 will be erased 
so the line that are not changed above that file will be run
